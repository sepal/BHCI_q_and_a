    "author": "Damjan",
    "body": "I think that the diagram is confusing and does not clearly differentiate between the fields; for example there is a label \"Interface Design\" and a label \"Application Design\" but it is not clear from the slide if Interface Design is a part of Application Design, Application Design is a part of Interface Design or they are completely independent. While the diagram may serve the purpose of illustrating the inter-disciplinary nature of HCI, I cannot find it anything but confusing and do not think that it is necessary. Maybe a simplified version which focuses only on the most important parts can show (or at least sketch, assuming that it is not important for every student to have an exact understanding of all the disciplines involved) the inter-disciplinary nature just as well, without the cognitive overload this diagram causes.",

        "body": "@Damjan - I think what they want to express with this slide, is the fact that Human Computer Interaction is a fairly big and complicated field, and that our focus is on the red spot. It is true that visually is not very informative, but I would guess it follows Venn's diagram's rules. I don't think though they'll ever go into the details of this diagram, as in my opinion is not important, you shouldn't break your head on this one."

Application Design would thus consist of Interface Design and Information Architecture."

# BHCI Q&A concept

This is a vertical concept for the lecture Basics of Human Computer Interaction 
at the [Vienna University of Technology](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/tuwien_home/). 

The app is build on top of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and 
[Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and also uses
BabelJS for transpiling [ES6](https://babeljs.io/) to ES5.

## Running 

To run the app you'll need to install the basic dependencies using 
[nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)/[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). After installing
NodeJS just run `npm install --production`, which will download jQuery and 
bootstrap-sass to the node_modules folder.

## Developing

The project depends on [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/)/[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
as package manager and build tool. After installing NodeJS run `npm install` to
get all dependencies. After that you can make changes to the code in `src` 
folder.

To build the javascript files run the command `npm run build-js` or 
`npm run build-sass` to compile the SASS files.
